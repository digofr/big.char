Description: This package extends bigmemory's big.matrix objects
    to support big vectors of character strings.  The only constraint
    is the user-specified maximum character length which must be
    satisfied for every string in the vector.  Shorter strings are
    padded with NAs, consuming (and wasting) space, but this is
    unavoidable given the use of memory-mapped files.
