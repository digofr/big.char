Errata addressed from testing of STAT 662 class:

big.char(0, 3) should be trapped properly.

Now issue warning if init=NULL because no initialization might be risky.

init=NA wasn't working; fixed so it actually initializes with NA.

Simplified big.char() code; checking is.null(y) wasn't necessary.

Allow init to be overly long, simply truncate for consistency.

shared=shared in creating the big.matrix()

Added documentation on special characters (DELETE, tab, etc...)

Added extra signature for blocking big.matrix inheritance, taking a
small step closer to ultimate intended usage.  Some things are still
allowed for debugging purposes only.
